            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>ALT SCHOOL ID: </strong>ALT/SOE/024/2477</p>
            <p>
                Good Day AltSchool. It has been quite interesting reflecting on my journey, predicting my tech career, and hoping that soon I would get to be that developer the little boy who grew up trying to demystify his parents’ mobile phones dreamt of. 
                That dream became more lucid when I received the good news that I have made the cut to this second stage. For all these—the hope, reflections, and chance—I heartily thank AltSchool.

                My name is <strong>Ugwuja Anthony Chinedu</strong>. I studied pharmacy at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, but like I always say, it is not the greatest thing I have done. 
                My greatest challenge and accomplishment has been being the eldest brother to four siblings in a financially struggling family. We grew up without much and had to manage everything.

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                In our situation, it was hard to dream past a sumptuous meal when you are done with your meager plate. But I had to, for the sake of my siblings and parents. 
                I was curious and strong-willed. Curiosity is essentially how I came in contact with Tech. I would admire and examine my parents’ mobile phones and vow to myself that one day I would create something much bigger.
            </p>
            <p>
                But coming from a humble family in a place like Nigeria chooses a path for you. You would study to be the best in your class, and you would opt for a professional course that would give you an immediate job guarantee upon graduation. 
                Moreover, my education was a path and a hope for my family. Today, I am a pre-intern pharmacist, and for that unending passion in Tech, I'm redirecting my focus into technology.

        <section id="goals" class="section">
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I still want to be the boy that builds something bigger than his parent's phones. Yet, I'm hindered by that same financial obstacle that has limited me since birth. Tech courses are essentially costly to purchase, and what is even more important is a tech community—some fertile ground to lay your adventitious roots right before the tap root starts to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                AltSchool is typically both. It is a professional learning platform as well as a peer and mentors networking community for sustainable career building in Information Technology. This is why this scholarship means everything to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since submitting an application for this cohort, I have improved a lot in my tech career. I have mastered graphic design and other kinds of visual work through my participation in a 50-day design challenge on social media. 
                I have created designs for various forms of artistic and technological items and platforms. Hence, I am opting to choose the **Frontend Development** track rather than the **Backend Development** I initially chose.
            </p>
            <ul class="goal-list">
                <li>Achieve an **intermediate level in Frontend Development** by the end of the 12-month program.</li>
                <li>Improve my skillset and distinguish myself as a **creative and dedicated developer**.</li>
                <li>Land an **internship or entry-level job** at a recognizable company.</li>
                <li>Use my earnings to **support my family, siblings, and loved ones**.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="commitment" class="section">
            <h2>My Commitment to AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                As an **intern-pharmacist (still seeking)**, I'll likely be working from morning till 3/4 PM, so I plan to take the **AltSchool course in the evening**, dedicating **at least 4 hours daily** to learn, practice, and connect with my peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a very rough ride in pharmacy school, but I graduated all the same. I'm still having a rough ride now. However, I know I can always come out on top of it all. This next phase of my life is about chasing my **childhood dream**, and I know it wouldn't be easy.
            </p>

        <section id="scholarship" class="section">
            <h2>Why This Scholarship Matters</h2>
            <p>
                This scholarship makes a **huge difference** for me. Getting it guarantees that I focus on the program itself, while the contrast means that I continue my social media challenges, taking every free tech course I see, and building my network bit by bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I'm **humbly asking** that you make this difference in my career by selecting me for the **AltSchool Scholarship**. Thank you.
